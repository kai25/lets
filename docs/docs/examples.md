## What are these examples ?

While there is no such difference which project and which language is used with `lets`, in general we belive it would give a better understanding on how to do things with `lets` right if examples will be suited for different languages and tools. 


You always can find more examples on [project's github page](https://github.com/lets-cli/lets/tree/master/examples).
